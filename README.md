# AR Gourmet

AR Gourmet is a mobile and web app designed to help restaurants to give an awesome experience to their customers, and to help their customers to make the best choice when ordering their food.

The idea was born thanks to my many of my bad experiences and my friendsâ€™ many bad experiences, going to restaurants and ordering food to be served with something totally unexpected.
